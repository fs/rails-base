## Initializes

* `01_config.rb` - shortcut for getting application config with `app_config`
* `mailer.rb` - setup default hosts for mailer from configuration
* `time_formats.rb` - setup default time formats, so you can use them like object.create_at.to_s(:us_time)
* `requires.rb` - automatically requires everything in lib/ & lib/extensions

## Scripts

* `script/bootstrap` - setup required gems and migrate db if needed
* `script/quality` - runs brakeman and rails_best_practices for the app
* `script/ci` - should be used in the CI, checkout .travis.yml for example

## Quick start

Clone application as new project with original repository named "rails3-base"

    git clone git://github.com/fs/rails3-base.git --origin rails3-base [MY-NEW-PROJECT]


Create your new repo on GitHub and push master into it.
Make sure master branch is tracking origin repo.

    git remote add origin git@github.com:[MY-GITHUB-ACCOUNT]/[MY-NEW-PROJECT].git
    git push -u origin master

Run bootstrap script

    script/bootstrap

Make sure all test are green

    bundle exec rspec spec
    bundle exec cucumber features
    
Run app 

    foreman start

## How to update existing project with new changes from rails3-base repo

You can fetch latest changes from rails3-base repo and merge or cherry-pick commits

    git fetch rails3-base
    git flow feature start rails3-base-update
    git merge rails3-base/master

    # fix conflicts
    # commit
    # test

    git flow feature finish rails3-base-update

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
